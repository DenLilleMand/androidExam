/**SimpleBaseGameActivity is just one of the many activities we can choose from,
 * other activies could be TheLayoutGameActivity, that is usually used to implement advertisements.
 * because it enables us to include native android SDK views such as buttons,seek bars, spinners,
 * additional layouts etc.
 * Then we have SimpleBaseGameActivity and SimpleLayoutGameActivity, which are different in the way that
 * they dont demand us to return something from the overriden methods, AndEngine will take care of this for us
 * and do the callbacks.  Then in the end we have SimpleAsyncGameActivity, which brings us a bunch of Async
 * alternatives, as you might want when doing a scroller game forexample, we can make a progress integer,
 * and load resources based on that progress, which means that we could do a big progress bar in the top
 * of the game, with a finish line, and then being able to motorcycle towards it. forexample inside of the
 * onCreateResources we can call a method:
 * pProgressListener.onProgressChanged(10);  that would be able to call a method whenever progress hits 10. */
